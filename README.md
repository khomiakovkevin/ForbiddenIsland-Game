# ForbiddenIsland-Game
ForbiddenIsland game implementation in Java

Short Description:
You awaken alone, marooned on an island.
You cannot recall how you got here, but desperately want to get back home.
Around you are scattered pieces of machinery, which you suspect are important somehow.
Looking up to the peak of the island, you see a somewhat ruined helicopter.
How convenient that you are a trained pilot — and mechanic!
You notice that the tide is rushing in: soon, the island will be flooded and the helicopter will be underwater.
Can you collect all the pieces of the helicopter and fly away before it’s too late?

Player mechanics:
The player is placed somewhere at random on the island. It is rendered onto the display.
The player is represented as a picture of pilot.
Use the arrow keys to move the player — but prevent the player from moving onto flooded cells.
If the player stays still long enough, and the water rises enough to flood the cell the player is standing on, the game is over.
Some number of helicopter pieces are randomly distributed around the island.
The pieces are drawn as simple circles.
The player must collect all the pieces and get to the highest point on the island where the crashed helicopter landed.

Use the ‘m’, ‘r’, and ‘t’ keys to reset the game and create a new mountain, random, or terrain island.
